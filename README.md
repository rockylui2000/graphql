# graphql

# Description of Project:

GraphQL aims to reduce this complexity by providing a simpler view of data and making it easier to query it.

We will implement the following methods under the “root” object:

1. restaurant: This gets a single restaurant based on a provided ID.
2. restaurants: This gets a list of all restaurants.
3. setrestaurant: This creates a new restaurant.
4. Deleterestaurant: This deletes a restaurant based on the provided id.
5. editrestaurant: This updates a restaurant based on the provided id.

# How to Run:

You can download all the files & folders to your local folder. Open terminal app:

1. type npm install
2. type npm run start

Open your browser and type http://localhost:5500/graphql to view the application.

# Roadmap of future improvements:

I plan to add more functionalities.
